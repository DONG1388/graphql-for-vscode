## [1.10.2](https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode/compare/v1.10.1...v1.10.2) (2018-05-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **release:** fix changelogs generation on release ([fc6051f](https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode/commit/fc6051f))

<hr>

### Notice
Due to some intermediate changes in the build process,
the changelogs from 1.10.1 till 1.0.1 are only hosted on the releases page of the github repo: [https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode/releases](https://github.com/kumarharsh/graphql-for-vscode/releases).

### 1.0.0
### Improved syntax highlighting in injected grammars
Also, refactored code and bumped the version to 1.0.0

### 0.4.0
### Go to Definition, Autocomplete & Schema Validation!
To use the syntax highlighting in your JS projects, you'll need to change your file's syntax to Javascript React, because this [doesn't work with Javascript Babel right now](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel/issues/6).

### 0.3.0
### Graphql syntax highlighting within JS/JSX/TS/TSX
To use the syntax highlighting in your JS projects, you'll need to change your file's syntax to Javascript React, because this [doesn't work with Javascript Babel right now](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel/issues/6).

### Improved syntax highlighting
The previous syntax highlighing was a little flaky and rather complex to maintain. This one is based off the [atom plugin](https://github.com/gandm/language-graphql-lb) by @gandm, and works much better and handles some cases which were not done previously.

### 0.2.2
Fixed enum syntax highlighting

### 0.2.1
Fixed some syntax highlights

### 0.1.1
Released as 0.2.0 due to excitement. Will be careful.

### 0.1.0
Extension released.
