# Notable Releases

### Presenting: Go to Definition, Autocomplete & Schema Validation!
To use the syntax highlighting in your JS projects, you'll need to change your file's syntax to Javascript React, because this [doesn't work with Javascript Babel right now](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel/issues/6).

## 0.3.0
### Graphql syntax highlighting within JS/JSX/TS/TSX
To use the syntax highlighting in your JS projects, you'll need to change your file's syntax to Javascript React, because this [doesn't work with Javascript Babel right now](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel/issues/6).

### Improved syntax highlighting
The previous syntax highlighing was a little flaky and rather complex to maintain. This one is based off the [atom plugin](https://github.com/gandm/language-graphql-lb) by @gandm, and works much better and handles some cases which were not done previously.

Fixed enum syntax highlighting
