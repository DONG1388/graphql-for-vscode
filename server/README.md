# Graphql For VSCode: Server

## Hacking
If you're making changes to the server, then run `npm run watch` inside this directory. This will copy the compiled `server.js` file into the client directory. Then, run the client in debug mode.

If you make any change in the server code, you need to reload the *Extension Development Host* instance of vscode.

*Happy Hacking!*
